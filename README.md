# Daily Menu Board


## Quick Intro

Aggregates daily lunch offerings of nearby restaurants.

## Demo 

http://dailymenuboard.surge.sh

## Description

We often had the problem that we had to open 4-5 webpages to decide where to go to have a lunch.
Every website publishes its daily menu offering in a unique format. Therefore this little application might be useful.


## Instructions

Tested with Chrome and FF.
2 restaurants are pre-filled. Another two can be added.
We plan to implement more user friendly features in the near future.
